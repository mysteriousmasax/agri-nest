# AGRI-NEST — Build & Platform Packaging

Quick start for packaging the existing web app into a PWA and native shells using Capacitor.

Prerequisites
- Node.js (16+)
- For Android: Android Studio + SDK
- For iOS: Xcode on macOS

Local web preview
```
npm install
npm run build:web
npm run start
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` — you land on the role picker. Sign in, register, or tap a role card to enter with a sample account. Data persists in your browser via `localStorage` (orders, listings, spray diary, wallet).

Prepare web assets (copies `app/` → `www/`)
```
npm run build:web
```

If npm is not available, use the PowerShell fallback:
```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/build-web-ps.ps1
```

Initialize Capacitor (one-time)
```
npm run cap:init
npx cap add android    # run on a machine with Android SDK
npx cap add ios        # run on macOS with Xcode
```

Build & run
- Android: open `android/` in Android Studio and run.
- iOS: open `ios/App/App.xcworkspace` in Xcode and run (macOS only).

Notes
- Native builds require platform tooling (Android Studio / Xcode) and signing keys.
- This repository prepares the web assets and Capacitor configuration. Plugins and native integrations should be added per feature requirements (camera, geolocation, push).
